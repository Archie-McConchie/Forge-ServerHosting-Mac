# Server-Hosting
Learn how to safely host your own Minecraft server with or without paper, quilt, neoforge, forge, bukkit and spigot mods on any operating system for your mates or for, anyone really. Learn how to keep yourself safe, and your IP and location hidden whilst your at it.

Why do it yourself and not just pay for a server hoster?
Well, for one this is free, but two, you have no restrictions, this way is highly customisable meaning you can invite as many players as you like or put whatever mods you want on your server. All of this ran on your own spare computer, or if you don't have a spare computer, on your main computer.

Forge, on macOS:
1. Figure out which version you will be using. In order to run mods on a server with your mates. Your computer, your friends computer, the server, the modloader (ie forge) and all the mods donwloaded need to have the same version. For example, if I have a 1.20.1 mod, ! will need to download the 1.20.1 version of forge.

2. Download the file, the 1.21 and 1.12.2 files are linked above, however if you want a direct download link or want a different version: visit the following link. 'https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/'. Select which version you want on the selection bar on the left and use the download button in the middle. You can either use the recommended or latest version. It doesn't matter.

3. Now that you have forge, before you run it, you will need to install java. Visit the following link: 'https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk22-archive-downloads.html' and scroll down until you find the macOS Arm and macOS x64 DMG download links. Download the Arm version with the link across the right of the page if your laptop has a M1,M2,M3 or later chipset in. Otherwise use x64 for intel macs. Make sure you download the DMG files otherwise you will not be able to install the file once you have it. If you are unsure if your macbook has a apple silicon chip (M1 etc) or an intel chip, you can click the apple icon at the top left of your screen and click 'about this mac'. It will say which chipset you have.

4. Once downloaded, install Java and follow the instructions on the setup.

5. You are now ready to install forge on your system with the first file you downloaded. Run the file, a box asking if you want to install forge for your client or server should pop up. Just ignore the other options as you won't need them for this. In order for a modded server with forge to work, the server and all the players must have forge and the mods installed on their own computers. If you didnt know, the client is your computer and the server is the computer your running the server off of. In order to install forge for the client, you will need to have minecraft installed. Note you won't need to have curseforge installed. Select the client and install forge if you havn't already, you don't need to worry about the directory at the bottom of the window, it should be set correctly automatically. If it isn't, navigate to (/Users/'your username'/Library/Application Support/minecraft) and install it there. Make sure your minecraft and launcher are closed whilst you do this otherwise it might not work. You can also improve your performance by installing optifine, however we'll cover that at the end.
