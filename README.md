# Server-Hosting
Learn how to safely host your own Minecraft server with or without paper, quilt, neoforge, forge, bukkit and spigot mods on any operating system for your mates or for, anyone really. Learn how to keep yourself safe, and your IP and location hidden whilst your at it.

Why do it yourself and not just pay for a server hoster?
Well, for one this is free, but two, you have no restrictions, this way is highly customisable meaning you can invite as many players as you like or put whatever mods you want on your server. All of this ran on your own spare computer, and if you don't have a spare computer you can run it on your main computer.

FORGE, on macOS:
1. Figure out which version you will be using. In order to run mods on a server with your mates. Your computer, your friends computer, the server, the modloader (ie forge) and all the mods donwloaded need to have the same version. For example, if I have a 1.20.1 mod, ! will need to download the 1.20.1 version of forge.
2. Download the file, the 1.21 and 1.12.2 files are linked above, however if you want a direct download link or want a different version: visit the following link. 'https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/'. Select which version you want on the selection bar on the left and use the download button in the middle. You can either use the recommended or latest version. It doesn't matter.
