# Server-Hosting
Learn how to safely host your own Minecraft server with or without paper, quilt, neoforge, forge, bukkit and spigot mods on any operating system for your mates or for, anyone really. Learn how to keep yourself safe, and your IP and location hidden whilst your at it.

Why do it yourself and not just pay for a server hoster?
Well, for one this is free, but two, you have no restrictions, this way is highly customisable meaning you can invite as many players as you like or put whatever mods you want on your server. All of this ran on your own spare computer, and if you don't have a spare computer you can run it on your main computer.
